abstract: >-
  A six-layer portrait of VDAC1 pharmacology synthesized from 20 IRIS runs,
  139 claims across five independent AI models, 22 verified novel findings,
  and 24 operationalized hypotheses. The central finding is a cofactor equation
  whose every variable has a physical address on the protein, and whose every
  term cancer corrupts simultaneously.
