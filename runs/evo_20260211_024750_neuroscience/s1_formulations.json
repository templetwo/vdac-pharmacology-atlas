This involves dissecting the biphasic CB1 receptor signaling pathways (e.g., G-protein vs. \u03b2-arrestin).\n2.  **Circuit-Level Correction:** How does CB1 activation correct age-related deficits? This requires examining the hypothesis that THC normalizes a pathologically elevated inhibitory tone in the aged hippocampus, thereby restoring the threshold for long-term potentiation (LTP).\n3.  **Structural vs. Cellular Plasticity:** What is the hierarchy and timeline of restored neuroplasticity? This involves distinguishing the relative contributions and temporal sequence of synaptic remodeling (spine density), BDNF signaling, and adult neurogenesis.\n\nKey variables: THC dose, CB1 signaling pathway (Gi vs. \u03b2-arrestin), hippocampal GABAergic tone, BDNF concentration, dendritic spine density, and rate of neurogenesis.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500 SECTION 2: CLAIMS (max 400 tokens) \u2500\u2500\u2500\nCLAIM: The therapeutic effect of THC is biphasic; low doses preferentially activate Gi-protein signaling to enhance cognition, while high doses recruit \u03b2-arrestin-2, causing receptor internalization and desensitization that negates the benefit.\nTYPE: 2\nCONFIDENCE: 0.85\nMECHANISM: Low CB1 receptor occupancy favors coupling to Gi/o, which activates the ERK/CREB cascade for synaptic plasticity, whereas high occupancy promotes \u03b2-arrestin-2 binding, leading to receptor downregulation.\nFALSIFIABLE BY: Aged animal models treated with a biased CB1 agonist that only activates Gi signaling show cognitive improvement at high doses, or \u03b2-arrestin-2 knockout animals show no cognitive decline with high-dose THC.\n\nCLAIM: Low-dose THC acts as a homeostatic corrective agent, not a universal enhancer, by reducing pathologically elevated GABAergic tone in the aged hippocampus, thereby restoring the capacity for LTP and BDNF expression.\nTYPE: 2\nCONFIDENCE: 0.75\nMECHANISM: In aged brains, excess GABAergic inhibition suppresses pyramidal neuron activity; THC-mediated presynaptic CB1 activation on interneurons reduces GABA release, disinhibiting pyramidal cells and enabling plasticity-related gene expression (e.g., BDNF) to return from impaired levels toward the healthy [20, 30] ng/mL range.\nFALSIFIABLE BY: Aged animals lacking elevated hippocampal GABAergic tone show no cognitive improvement with low-dose THC.\n\nCLAIM: The rapid cognitive restoration is driven primarily by synaptic remodeling (dendritic spine formation), with adult neurogenesis (rate ~700 neurons/day) being a slower, secondary contributor to long-term consolidation.\nTYPE: 1\nCONFIDENCE: 0.90\nMECHANISM: BDNF-mediated LTP enhancement rapidly stabilizes new dendritic spines over hours to days, while the integration of new neurons from neurogenesis is a multi-week process, making it an insufficient explanation for acute cognitive reversal.\nFALSIFIABLE BY: Pharmacological blockade of spine formation, but not neurogenesis, prevents the rapid cognitive benefits of low-dose THC in aged mice.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500 SECTION 3: UNKNOWNS (max 150 tokens) \u2500\u2500\u2500\nThe precise CB1 receptor occupancy percentage that defines the switch from therapeutic Gi signaling to detrimental \u03b2-arrestin recruitment is unknown. We also lack data on whether this threshold changes with age or is uniform across hippocampal subfields (e.g., CA1 vs. DG). The contribution of non-neuronal cells, particularly astrocytes expressing CB1 receptors, to this restorative process is poorly quantified. The translatability of the effective \"low dose\" from murine models to humans remains a major gap.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500 SECTION 4: NEXT STEP (max 50 tokens) \u2500\u2500\u2500\nConduct PET imaging in aged non-human primates using tracers for both CB1 receptor occupancy and a marker for synaptic density (e.g., SV2A) during low- vs. high-dose THC administration.",
