Protocol: evo-1.0

QUESTION:
  What determines whether VDAC1 engagement by a small molecule results in neuroprotection versus cytotoxicity? Specifically, how do cell-type-specific cofactor landscapes — including HK-II occupancy, Bcl-2 family association, and tubulin binding — set the threshold at which VDAC1 transitions from metabolic gating to oligomerization-mediated apoptosis?
