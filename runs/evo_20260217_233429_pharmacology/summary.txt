Protocol: evo-1.0

QUESTION:
  What are the mechanisms by which ketamine produces rapid antidepressant effects within hours, and is there a mitochondrial component beyond NMDA receptor antagonism? Specifically: (1) Does ketamine at sub-anesthetic doses (0.5 mg/kg IV) alter mitochondrial membrane potential or VDAC1 state? (2) Is the rapid onset (2-4 hours vs weeks for SSRIs) consistent with a synaptic plasticity mechanism alone, or does mitochondrial bioenergetic rescue contribute? (3) Does ketamine follow the structural isomorphism pattern — dose picks pathway, tissue determines outcome — with sub-anesthetic producing BDNF/mTOR-dependent synaptogenesis and supra-anesthetic producing dissociation/neurotoxicity? (4) What is the role of ketamine's metabolite (2R,6R)-HNK in sustained antidepressant effects, and does it have a distinct mitochondrial target? (5) Can the therapeutic window be predicted by the same Hill coefficient mismatch that governs metformin (cooperative target saturates before toxic target engages)?
