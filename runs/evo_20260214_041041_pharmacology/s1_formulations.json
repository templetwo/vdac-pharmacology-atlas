What is the quantitative relationship between psilocin concentration, 5-HT2A receptor occupancy, and the differential activation potency (EC50) for the Gq/11 versus the \u03b2-arrestin 2 signaling pathways?\n2.  How does the abrupt, non-linear recruitment of \u03b2-arrestin 2 above ~60% occupancy mechanistically create a therapeutic index (TD50/ED50) of approximately 10, consistent with established safety priors?\n3.  What is the specific molecular structure of the psilocin-bound 5-HT2A/mGluR2/\u03b2-arrestin 2 complex that explains the uncoupling of mGluR2's inhibitory function on cortical glutamate release?\n\nKey variables are psilocin concentration [Psilocin], fractional receptor occupancy (%Occ), Gq/11 pathway activation, \u03b2-arrestin 2 recruitment, and the resulting clinical outcomes (neuroplasticity vs. perceptual destabilization). The core of the question is the switch mechanism between pathways.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500 SECTION 2: CLAIMS (max 400 tokens) \u2500\u2500\u2500\nCLAIM: The dose-dependent divergence is a direct result of psilocin's biased agonism, where it exhibits significantly higher potency for the therapeutic Gq/11 pathway than for the adverse \u03b2-arrestin 2 pathway, creating a functional therapeutic window.\nTYPE: 2\nCONFIDENCE: 0.9\nMECHANISM: Psilocin's EC50 for Gq/11 activation is reached at low nanomolar concentrations (~20-50% occupancy), while its EC50 for robust \u03b2-arrestin 2 recruitment is an order of magnitude higher, requiring >60% occupancy to initiate destabilizing glutamate release.\nFALSIFIABLE BY: In vitro cell-based assays (e.g., BRET, TR-FRET) demonstrating that psilocin's potency (EC50) and efficacy (Emax) for \u03b2-arrestin 2 recruitment are equal to or greater than for Gq/11-mediated IP1 accumulation.\n\nCLAIM: The therapeutic index of psilocybin (TD50/ED50 \u2248 10) is a direct, predictable consequence of the occupancy gap between the onset of therapeutic Gq signaling and the threshold for adverse \u03b2-arrestin signaling.\nTYPE: 1\nCONFIDENCE: 0.95\nMECHANISM: The ED50 for neuroplasticity (~5 mg dose) corresponds to ~30-40% occupancy, while the TD50 for perceptual destabilization (~50 mg dose) corresponds to ~70-80% occupancy; this ~10x dose ratio maps directly onto the steep, non-linear Hill curve for receptor binding.\nFALSIFIABLE BY: Human PET imaging studies showing the dose required to achieve 75% 5-HT2A occupancy is less than 5 times the dose required to achieve 35% occupancy.\n\nCLAIM: The \"cooperative recruitment\" of \u03b2-arrestin 2 is an allosteric effect imposed by the 5-HT2A/mGluR2 heterodimer structure itself, which acts as a molecular AND-gate requiring high psilocin concentrations to stabilize the necessary multi-receptor conformation.\nTYPE: 3\nCONFIDENCE: 0.65\nMECHANISM: This supramolecular complex may require simultaneous agonist binding to both receptor protomers to induce the conformational change needed for \u03b2-arrestin docking, a low-probability event at low occupancy that becomes likely only at high occupancy.\nFALSIFIABLE BY: Cryo-EM structural data showing that a single psilocin-bound 5-HT2A protomer is sufficient to recruit \u03b2-arrestin 2 to the intact heterodimer.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500 SECTION 3: UNKNOWNS (max 150 tokens) \u2500\u2500\u2500\nThe specific in vivo EC50 and bias factor of psilocin for Gq vs. \u03b2-arrestin 2 pathways at the human 5-HT2A receptor are unknown; current values are inferred. The precise stoichiometry and structure of the 5-HT2A/mGluR2/\u03b2-arrestin 2 complex have not been resolved, preventing a full understanding of the uncoupling mechanism. We lack direct measurements of synaptic psilocin and glutamate concentrations in the human brain as a function of oral dose, which would be needed to fully validate the model. The regional density of 5-HT2A/mGluR2 heterodimers versus 5-HT2A homodimers is also unknown.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500 SECTION 4: NEXT STEP (max 50 tokens) \u2500\u2500\u2500\nConduct parallel in vitro assays using BRET or Tango systems on human 5-HT2A receptors to quantitatively determine the precise EC50 and Emax for psilocin-induced Gq activation versus \u03b2-arrestin 2 recruitment.",
