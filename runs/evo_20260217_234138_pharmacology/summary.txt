Protocol: evo-1.0

QUESTION:
  What is the role of calcium oscillations in VDAC1 gating, and does the frequency of mitochondrial calcium uptake encode information about cell fate? Specifically: (1) VDAC1 is voltage-gated and calcium-permeable — do physiological calcium oscillations (0.1-10 Hz) open and close VDAC1 rhythmically, creating a pulsatile metabolite flux? (2) Does the frequency of calcium transients determine whether VDAC1 stays monomeric (survival) or oligomerizes (death) — is there a frequency threshold? (3) How does the MCU (mitochondrial calcium uniporter) on the IMM coordinate with VDAC1 on the OMM to create a two-gate calcium filter? (4) Do cancer cells show altered calcium oscillation frequencies that keep VDAC1 in the monomeric state, and is this another mechanism of gate-jamming beyond HK-II/Bcl-xL/cholesterol? (5) Can calcium oscillation frequency be a therapeutic target — could pacing mitochondrial calcium uptake shift VDAC1 toward the oligomeric (pro-apoptotic) state in cancer?
