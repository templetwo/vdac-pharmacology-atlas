IRIS GATE EVO — PROTOCOL PACKAGE
============================================================

Session: evo_20260213_174104_pharmacology
Date: 2026-02-13
Protocol: evo-1.0

QUESTION:
  What structural features of VDAC isoforms determine ligand selectivity? Specifically: (1) Do CBD, erastin, and DIDS share a common binding site on VDAC1 or engage distinct allosteric mechanisms? (2) What structural differences between VDAC1 and VDAC2 — particularly the additional N-terminal residues of VDAC2 and the BAK-binding interface — could enable isoform-selective ligand design? (3) Does the VDAC1 N-terminal helix (gating domain) vs barrel wall (conductance domain) distinction predict different pharmacological outcomes for allosteric modulators vs pore blockers? (4) Is VDAC2-sparing compound design feasible given >70% transmembrane homology, or must selectivity be achieved through the cofactor landscape (HK-II occupancy, BAK competition)?
