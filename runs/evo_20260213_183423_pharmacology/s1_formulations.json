How does the specific lipid microenvironment at OMM contact sites (e.g., cardiolipin patches) alter VDAC structure/function compared to bulk OMM? 2. How do cancer-associated shifts in OMM cholesterol/phospholipid ratio affect the membrane partitioning and effective local concentration of lipophilic ligands (like CBD) near VDAC? 3. Does the efficacy of cholesterol-sensitive VDAC ligands (like olesoxime) depend on a threshold membrane cholesterol level, explaining cell-type-specific outcomes? 4. Can lipid composition of a delivery vehicle be tuned to selectively enrich a VDAC modulator in a target cell's OMM? Key variables: local lipid composition, ligand logP/membrane partition coefficient, VDAC-lipid binding sites, apparent Kd at the membrane.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500 SECTION 2: CLAIMS (max 400 tokens) \u2500\u2500\u2500\nCLAIM: Cardiolipin at OMM contact sites alters VDAC gating dynamics, likely promoting a conformation with higher affinity for certain ligands (e.g., olesoxime) but not necessarily CBD.\nTYPE: 2\nCONFIDENCE: 0.7\nMECHANISM: Cardiolipin's negative charge and conical shape distort local membrane curvature and electrostatics, stabilizing specific VDAC oligomeric states or tilts.\nFALSIFIABLE BY: In vitro electrophysiology showing identical VDAC gating in pure PC vs PC+cardiolipin membranes.\n\nCLAIM: Increased OMM cholesterol in some cancers significantly raises the effective local concentration of CBD at VDAC, lowering its apparent functional Kd below the measured 11 \u00b5M.\nTYPE: 1\nCONFIDENCE: 0.8\nMECHANISM: Higher cholesterol increases membrane order and partition coefficient for lipophilic CBD (logP 6.3), enriching it in the OMM and increasing probability of VDAC interaction.\nFALSIFIABLE BY: Measuring CBD binding to VDAC in lipid nanodiscs with high vs low cholesterol showing no Kd difference.\n\nCLAIM: Olesoxime's neuroprotective effect requires an optimal, intermediate OMM cholesterol level, explaining its cell-type-specific activity.\nTYPE: 2\nCONFIDENCE: 0.75\nMECHANISM: Too little cholesterol prevents olesoxime's membrane recruitment via its cholesterol-recognition motif; too much cholesterol competitively inhibits its specific binding site on VDAC.\nFALSIFIABLE BY: Olesoxime showing identical VDAC binding and cytoprotection in cells with very high and very low membrane cholesterol.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500 SECTION 3: UNKNOWNS (max 150 tokens) \u2500\u2500\u2500\n1. Quantitative lipidomics data for OMM (not whole mitochondria) in specific cancer vs healthy cell lines. 2. Experimentally determined membrane-water partition coefficient (logKp) for CBD in membranes of varying cholesterol content. 3. High-resolution structure of VDAC1 in a native-like lipid bilayer containing cardiolipin and cholesterol. 4. Direct measurement of the apparent Kd of CBD for VDAC in intact cancer vs normal mitochondria, using a membrane-embedded assay.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500 SECTION 4: NEXT STEP (max 50 tokens) \u2500\u2500\u2500\nMeasure CBD binding affinity (via fluorescence quenching or SPR) to purified VDAC reconstituted into lipid nanodiscs with defined compositions mimicking healthy vs cancer OMM.",
