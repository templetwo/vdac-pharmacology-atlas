IRIS GATE EVO — PROTOCOL PACKAGE
============================================================

Session: evo_20260213_183423_pharmacology
Date: 2026-02-13
Protocol: evo-1.0

QUESTION:
  Does the outer mitochondrial membrane lipid composition modulate VDAC-ligand interactions differently in healthy vs cancer mitochondria? Specifically: (1) Cardiolipin is enriched in inner mitochondrial membrane but present in OMM contact sites — does it alter VDAC gating or CBD binding at these sites? (2) Cancer cell membranes have altered cholesterol/phospholipid ratios — does this change the effective Kd of lipophilic VDAC modulators like CBD (logP 6.3)? (3) Olesoxime (TRO19622) binds VDAC via a cholesterol-recognition motif — does membrane cholesterol content determine whether olesoxime is neuroprotective or neutral? (4) Could membrane-targeted delivery (liposomes with specific lipid compositions) enhance or reduce VDAC modulator potency in a cell-type-specific way?
