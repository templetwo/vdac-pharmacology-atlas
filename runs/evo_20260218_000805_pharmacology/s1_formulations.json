This requires distinguishing between evolutionary origin (it was already there) and current functional architecture (it is a discrete gene product with a defined fold).\n\n**Sub-question 2:** Does the lipid annulus constitute a regulatory co-factor or an integral structural subunit? This determines whether VDAC is a protein-with-context or a membrane-state-with-protein-scaffold.\n\n**Sub-question 3:** Is the hexagonal lattice a protein-protein crystallization event nucleated by lipids, or a membrane phase transition seeded by protein? The distinction has measurable thermodynamic signatures.\n\n**Sub-question 4:** Can threshold behavior exist without VDAC protein \u2014 is the principle separable from its implementation?\n\nKey variables: lipid composition (cardiolipin/cholesterol ratio), VDAC surface density, lateral pressure profile, temperature, Bcl-2 family protein concentration.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500 SECTION 2: CLAIMS \u2500\u2500\u2500\n\n**CLAIM:** VDAC1 is best understood as a *boundary object* \u2014 neither purely protein nor membrane property, but the stable structural solution to a physical constraint (controlled permeability across a bacterial-derived outer membrane).

Is the hexagonal lattice a protein-driven crystallization or a lipid-driven phase transition for which VDAC1 is a necessary scaffold?\n3.  How does CBD's weak, indirect interaction with the VDAC1-lipid system explain its poor therapeutic index, and what does this imply about VDAC1 as a drug target?\n4.  Can the physical principles of lipid membranes (e.g., phase boundaries) account for VDAC1's *specific* biological function (anion-selective, voltage-gated flux), or is the protein architecture indispensable?\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500 SECTION 2: CLAIMS (max 400 tokens) \u2500\u2500\u2500\nCLAIM: VDAC1 is a mechanosensitive reporter of the OMM's physical state, transducing membrane stress into regulated ion flux.\nTYPE: 2\nCONFIDENCE: 0.9\nMECHANISM: The protein's gating is allosterically controlled by the lateral pressure, thickness, and lipid composition of its non-exchangeable annulus.\nFALSIFIABLE BY: VDAC1 gating in a reconstituted system proves to be independent of controlled membrane tension and lipid phase.\n\nCLAIM: The hexagonal lattice is a lipid-protein co-assembly where VDAC1 oligomers nucleate a cardiolipin-driven, ordered-phase transition in the OMM.\nTYPE: 1\nCONFIDENCE: 0.85\nMECHANISM: Protein oligomers locally concentrate cardiolipin, which in turn mediates the long-range crystalline ordering of the combined system.\nFALSIFIABLE BY: Formation of the characteristic hexagonal lattice in cryo-EM using lipid compositions completely lacking cardiolipin.\n\nCLAIM: CBD's poor therapeutic index (~0.09) results from an indirect mechanism; it partitions into the membrane to alter the lipid annulus, requiring high concentrations (Kd=11\u00b5M) relative to potent off-target effects (CYP3A4 at 1\u00b5M).\nTYPE: 1\nCONFIDENCE: 0.92\nMECHANISM: CBD's high lipophilicity drives membrane accumulation, which non-specifically alters local mechanics and VDAC1 gating.\nFALSIFIABLE BY: A crystal structure showing CBD occupying a specific, high-affinity binding pocket on the VDAC1 protein itself.\n\nCLAIM: A VDAC1-free membrane cannot replicate the channel's specific, voltage-gated anion selectivity.\nTYPE: 1\nCONFIDENCE: 0.95\nMECHANISM: While lipid phase boundaries can form transient, non-selective pores, VDAC1's defined beta-barrel architecture is required for specific anion transport and reproducible voltage gating.\nFALSIFIABLE BY: A synthetic, protein-free lipid bilayer demonstrating stable, anion-selective, voltage-gated pores.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500 SECTION 3: UNKNOWNS (max 150 tokens) \u2500\u2500\u2500\nThe precise lipid stoichiometry of the non-exchangeable VDAC1 annulus versus the bulk OMM is unknown. We lack quantitative data mapping local membrane pressure or curvature modulus directly to VDAC1's open-state probability. The binding kinetics and exact location of Bax/Bak oligomers relative to the VDAC1 pore during apoptosis initiation are not resolved at an atomic level.
