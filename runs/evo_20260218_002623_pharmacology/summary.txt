QUESTION:
  What does the cofactor equation predict about why some cancers respond to immunotherapy while others don't, and can VDAC1 state serve as a predictive biomarker for immunotherapy response? Consider: (1) VDAC1 oligomerization leaks mtDNA into the cytoplasm, activating cGAS-STING innate immune signaling. Cancer cells that successfully jam the gate (high f_HKII, high f_BclxL, high Chol/CL) prevent VDAC oligomerization and therefore prevent immune detection. Does gate-jamming predict immune cold tumors? (2) Could pharmacological gate-restoration (HK-II displacement + Bcl-xL inhibition) convert immune-cold tumors to immune-hot by forcing VDAC oligomerization and mtDNA release? (3) The checkpoint inhibitor paradox: PD-1/PD-L1 blockade works when the immune system can already see the tumor. If the tumor is invisible because VDAC never oligomerizes (no mtDNA leak, no cGAS-STING), checkpoint inhibitors have nothing to amplify. Prediction: gate-restoring drugs + checkpoint inhibitors should show synergy specifically in immune-cold tumors. (4) Can f_HKII occupancy or Chol/CL ratio measured from tumor biopsies predict which patients benefit from immunotherapy? (5) Does the cofactor equation explain why metabolically active tumors (high Warburg, high glycolysis) tend to be immune-cold — the same metabolic investment that jams the gate also prevents immune visibility?
