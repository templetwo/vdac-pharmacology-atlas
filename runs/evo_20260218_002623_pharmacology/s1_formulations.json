Does the cofactor model predict that high HK-II/Bcl-xL/Chol occupancy of VDAC1 (\"gate-jamming\") suppresses mtDNA release and cGAS-STING signaling, creating immune-cold tumors?\n2. Can pharmacological displacement of these cofactors force VDAC1 oligomerization, restore mtDNA leak and innate immune signaling, and thus convert immune-cold to immune-hot tumors?\n3. Does the model predict synergy between gate-restoring drugs and checkpoint inhibitors specifically in immune-cold tumors, and can VDAC1 cofactor occupancy (f_HKII, Chol/CL) serve as a predictive biomarker for immunotherapy response?\n4. Does the model explain the correlation between high Warburg glycolysis (which increases HK-II binding) and immune-cold phenotypes?\n\nKey variables: f_HKII, f_BclxL, Chol/CL ratio (determinants of VDAC1 open/oligomerized state). Their high occupancy stabilizes the closed state, preventing oligomerization and mtDNA leak, reducing cGAS-STING activation and immune visibility.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500 SECTION 2: CLAIMS (max 400 tokens) \u2500\u2500\u2500\nCLAIM: High fractional occupancy of VDAC1 by HK-II and Bcl-xL, plus a high Chol/CL ratio, predicts immune-cold tumors by preventing VDAC1 oligomerization and mtDNA-driven cGAS-STING activation.\nTYPE: 1\nCONFIDENCE: 0.75\nMECHANISM: These cofactors stabilize the VDAC1 closed state, physically blocking pore oligomerization required for mtDNA release, thereby silencing a key innate immune signal.\nFALSIFIABLE BY: Finding immune-hot tumors with demonstrably high HK-II/VDAC1 binding and high mitochondrial cholesterol, or immune-cold tumors with low cofactor occupancy and no mtDNA in cytosol.\n\nCLAIM: Pharmacological displacement of HK-II and inhibition of Bcl-xL will synergize with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade specifically in immune-cold tumors, but not in already immune-hot tumors.\nTYPE: 2\nCONFIDENCE: 0.65\nMECHANISM: Gate-restoring drugs induce VDAC1 oligomerization and mtDNA leak, initiating innate immune recognition (creating \"signal 1\"), which checkpoint inhibitors can then amplify by removing T-cell inhibition.\nFALSIFIABLE BY: A clinical trial showing no added benefit of a VDAC1 gate-restorer + anti-PD1 in immune-cold tumors versus anti-PD1 alone.\n\nCLAIM: The f_HKII (HK-II occupancy) or Chol/CL ratio from tumor biopsies can serve as a predictive biomarker for intrinsic resistance to checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy.\nTYPE: 2\nCONFIDENCE: 0.60\nMECHANISM: These metrics directly report on the probability of VDAC1 oligomerization and thus the tumor's baseline ability to activate cGAS-STING, which is prerequisite for checkpoint inhibitor efficacy.\nFALSIFIABLE BY: A prospective study showing no correlation between these measured ratios and objective response rate to anti-PD1/PD-L1.\n\nCLAIM: The Warburg effect promotes immune evasion not only via lactate but also by increasing HK-II binding to VDAC1, directly jamming the mtDNA leak pathway.\nTYPE: 3\nCONFIDENCE: 0.55\nMECHANISM: High glycolytic flux increases mitochondrial HK-II binding, which stabilizes VDAC1 in a closed, non-oligomerizing state, providing a direct metabolic link between glycolysis and immune invisibility.\nFALSIFIABLE BY: Demonstrating that Warburg-active tumors with genetically severed HK-II-VDAC1 binding remain immune-cold.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500 SECTION 3: UNKNOWNS (max 150 tokens) \u2500\u2500\u2500\n1. The quantitative threshold of cytosolic mtDNA required to trigger a sustained cGAS-STING response in the tumor microenvironment is unknown.\n2. The relative contribution of VDAC1-mediated mtDNA leak versus other pathways (e.g., ROS, mitophagy defects) to spontaneous cGAS-STING activation in human tumors is unmeasured.\n3. The pharmacokinetics and tumor penetration of putative \"gate-restoring\" drugs (HK-II displacers, Bcl-xL inhibitors) and their specific effect on VDAC1 oligomerization in vivo are unknown.\n4. Whether the Chol/CL ratio in tumor mitochondria correlates with biopsy-measurable lipid profiles is unclear.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500 SECTION 4: NEXT STEP (max 50 tokens) \u2500\u2500\u2500\nCorrelate VDAC1 cofactor occupancy (f_HKII by proximity ligation assay, Chol/CL by mass spec) with cytosolic mtDNA and T-cell infiltration in a matched cohort of human tumors with known immunotherapy response data.",
