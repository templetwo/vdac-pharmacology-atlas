IRIS GATE EVO — PROTOCOL PACKAGE
============================================================

Session: evo_20260213_184357_pharmacology
Date: 2026-02-13
Protocol: evo-1.0

QUESTION:
  Beyond CBD, which commonly prescribed drugs or their metabolites interact with VDAC at therapeutically relevant concentrations? (1) Valproic acid is a known hepatotoxin and mitochondrial modulator — does it engage VDAC1? (2) Acetaminophen toxicity involves mitochondrial dysfunction — is VDAC part of the NAPQI damage cascade? (3) Metformin accumulates in mitochondria and inhibits Complex I — does it also modulate VDAC gating? (4) Statins (particularly lipophilic ones like atorvastatin) partition into membranes — is VDAC occupancy a hidden variable in statin-associated myopathy? (5) What is the predicted VDAC interaction landscape for the top 20 most prescribed drugs with known mitochondrial effects?
