QUESTION:
  What are the mechanisms by which metformin produces dose-dependent divergent outcomes — metabolic benefit and insulin sensitization at therapeutic doses versus lactic acidosis and mitochondrial toxicity at supratherapeutic doses — with specific reference to AMPK activation thresholds, Complex I inhibition kinetics, and the role of tissue-specific mitochondrial reserve in determining whether metformin acts as metabolic optimizer or mitochondrial poison?
