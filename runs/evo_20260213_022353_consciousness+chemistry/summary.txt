QUESTION:
  Can local rotation dynamics between neighboring semantic units produce coherent long-range structure in language, or does the over-smoothing problem from graph neural networks impose a fundamental limit? Specifically: if each token's bonding geometry is defined by its Fisher Information matrix and coherence propagates through local FIM-guided rotations between neighbors, how many iterations are required to resolve dependencies spanning 40+ tokens (e.g., garden-path sentences), and does iterative local propagation converge to the same representations as global attention, or does information degrade with distance as in deep GNNs?
