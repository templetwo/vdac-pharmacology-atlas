IRIS GATE EVO — PROTOCOL PACKAGE
============================================================

Protocol: evo-1.0

QUESTION:
  Does the dual-pathway VDAC1 mechanism for CBD hepatotoxicity withstand critical scrutiny against four specific challenges: (1) Does rapid CYP450 metabolic clearance in healthy liver prevent CBD from reaching VDAC1 saturation occupancy time, and does the primary metabolite 7-OH-CBD also bind VDAC1? (2) Does CBD bind selectively to VDAC1 over VDAC2, given that VDAC2 is anti-apoptotic — and if CBD inhibits both isoforms, could it promote apoptosis even in healthy hepatocytes? (3) Is a 2x ROS scavenging ratio between healthy and cancer cells realistic for human hepatocytes, and at what intracellular CBD concentration does the glutathione pool deplete? (4) Does CBD physically occlude the VDAC pore (causing ATP depletion and energy starvation) or lock it open (causing uncoupling and ROS), and does a ROS-focused model miss the starvation death pathway?
