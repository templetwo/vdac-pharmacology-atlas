Protocol: evo-1.0

QUESTION:
  What are the mechanisms by which erastin induces ferroptotic cell death through VDAC1/2/3, and why does it show selectivity for RAS-mutant cancer cells? Specifically: (1) Does erastin bind VDAC directly or alter its gating indirectly through lipid/protein interactions? (2) How does VDAC opening by erastin connect to GSH depletion, GPX4 inhibition, and lipid peroxide accumulation? (3) Does the cofactor equation (Threshold = K/[(1-f_HKII)(1-f_BclxL)] × [Chol]/[CL]) predict which cells are vulnerable to erastin-induced ferroptosis? (4) Why do RAS-mutant cells show 10-fold greater sensitivity — is this a VDAC-state dependency or a metabolic reserve difference? (5) What is the relationship between erastin-induced VDAC opening and the voltage-dependent conductance shift from anion-selective to cation-selective state?
