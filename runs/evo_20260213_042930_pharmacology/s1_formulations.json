This generates ROS load well within the 24hr GSH regeneration budget (consuming <5% of daily synthesis capacity in healthy liver).\nTYPE: 2\nCONFIDENCE: 0.65\nMECHANISM: Low fractional occupancy produces modest mitochondrial stress; hepatic GSH pool (~7 mmol total) turns over ~4-6x daily, providing massive buffer.\nFALSIFIABLE BY: Pharmacokinetic data showing portal CBD concentrations >5 uM after 50mg oral dosing, or direct measurement of hepatic GSH depletion >10% at this dose.\n\nCLAIM: CBD-VDAC1 binding is reversible on timescales of 1-4 hours based on lipophilic ligand-membrane protein kinetics; allosteric gating perturbation resets upon dissociation without persistent conformational memory.\nTYPE: 3\nCONFIDENCE: 0.45\nMECHANISM: No evidence for covalent modification; VDAC gating is voltage/lipid-dependent and channels reconstitute normal conductance states in bilayer experiments after ligand washout.\nFALSIFIABLE BY: Electrophysiology showing persistent gating abnormality post-CBD washout, or evidence of post-translational modification induced by CBD binding.\n\nCLAIM: 7-OH-CBD accumulation at steady-state (50mg/day) may increase effective VDAC occupancy window by 30-60%, but total combined occupancy remains below levels causing net GSH depletion in healthy liver.\nTYPE: 3\nCONFIDENCE: 0.40\nMECHANISM: 7-OH-CBD has ~2-3x longer half-life; if VDAC affinity is similar to parent, trough occupancy rises but peak combined concentration likely remains <3-4 uM.\nFALSIFIABLE BY: Measurement of 7-OH-CBD VDAC binding affinity showing Kd <3 uM, or steady-state 7-OH-CBD plasma levels exceeding parent compound.\n\nCLAIM: The null hypothesis (progressive GSH depletion at 50mg/day in healthy liver) is likely defeated.

I will decompose it into three parts:\n\n1.  **Hepatocellular Supply Capacity:** What is the baseline rate of GSH synthesis in healthy vs. compromised livers? This defines the cell's capacity to buffer the insult.\n2.  **Chronic Demand Load:** What is the effective daily mitochondrial load imposed by 50mg oral CBD? This requires calculating the integrated hepatocyte exposure to parent CBD and its active metabolites (7-OH-CBD) after accounting for bioavailability and first-pass metabolism.\n3.  **Mechanism & Accumulation Dynamics:** Is the insult transient or cumulative? This depends on the reversibility of CBD-VDAC binding and whether the gating perturbation persists after dissociation, which determines if effects accumulate between doses.\n\nKey variables are GSH synthesis rate (umol/g/hr), intra-hepatocyte CBD/metabolite concentration (uM), and VDAC occupancy (%).\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500 SECTION 2: CLAIMS (max 400 tokens) \u2500\u2500\u2500\nCLAIM: The *de novo* GSH synthesis rate in a healthy human liver (~2.3 umol/g/hr) is robust, but can be impaired by >50% (>2x difference) in metabolically compromised states like NAFLD, drastically reducing the buffering capacity.\nTYPE: 1\nCONFIDENCE: 0.9\nMECHANISM: Healthy hepatocytes maintain high GSH turnover, but conditions like NAFLD involve oxidative stress and inflammation that both consume GSH and downregulate key synthesis enzymes (e.g., GCLC).\nFALSIFIABLE BY: A study showing that GSH synthesis rates in cohorts with diagnosed, moderate-to-severe NAFLD are consistently within 50% of healthy controls.\n\nCLAIM: At 50mg/day, the peak mitochondrial VDAC occupancy in a healthy individual remains far below the toxic threshold, and the resultant ROS load is a minor fraction (<5%) of the liver's daily GSH regeneration capacity.\nTYPE: 2\nCONFIDENCE: 0.8\nMECHANISM: A 50mg oral dose yields low micromolar or sub-micromolar plasma concentrations; even with first-pass accumulation, sustained hepatocyte concentrations are unlikely to approach the 11 uM VDAC1 Kd, resulting in minimal occupancy and a negligible oxidative burden.\nFALSIFIABLE BY: Direct measurement of hepatocyte CBD concentration via liver biopsy or advanced imaging in subjects at steady-state 50mg/day dosing, showing levels consistently >5 uM.\n\nCLAIM: CBD-VDAC allosteric binding is reversible on a timescale of hours, and the channel's gating function resets upon CBD dissociation, preventing cumulative VDAC dysfunction between standard 12-24 hour dosing intervals.\nTYPE: 2\nCONFIDENCE: 0.85\nMECHANISM: Allosteric modulation is typically a transient, concentration-dependent process; without a covalent bond or induced conformational lock, the protein should revert to its native state as local CBD concentration decreases post-absorption.\nFALSIFIABLE BY: Patch-clamp electrophysiology showing that VDAC channels from CBD-treated mitochondria retain altered gating properties even after extensive washout.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500 SECTION 3: UNKNOWNS (max 150 tokens) \u2500\u2500\u2500\n1.  **VDAC Binding Affinity of 7-OH-CBD:** The Kd for the primary, long-half-life metabolite's interaction with VDAC1/2 is unknown. If it binds with significantly higher affinity than parent CBD (e.g., Kd < 1 uM), it could dominate the chronic occupancy effect.\n2.  **Intra-mitochondrial CBD Concentration:** We lack data on the concentration of CBD and 7-OH-CBD within the hepatocyte mitochondrial intermembrane space following first-pass metabolism of a low oral dose. Plasma Cmax is a poor proxy for this key parameter.\n3.  **ROS Stoichiometry:** The quantitative relationship between a single CBD-VDAC binding event and the number of ROS molecules generated is not established.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500 SECTION 4: NEXT STEP (max 50 tokens) \u2500\u2500\u2500\nConduct a 28-day study in human liver organoids (healthy vs. NAFLD models) dosed with CBD/7-OH-CBD, measuring daily GSH levels and mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate to directly assess cumulative impact.",
