Protocol: evo-1.0

QUESTION:
  Chronic Dosing Dynamics: GSH Regeneration vs Cumulative Mitochondrial Load. Context: The acute model establishes CBD as a universal mitochondrial stressor (VDAC1+VDAC2 engagement), with survival determined by GSH buffering capacity (>20 uM threshold). The EFSA limit (2mg/day) targets chronic exposure. This session stress-tests the chronic accumulation hypothesis. Questions: (1) GSH Synthesis Rate: What is the de novo glutathione synthesis rate in healthy human hepatocytes (umol/g liver/hr)? Does it vary by >2x between healthy and metabolically compromised liver (NAFLD, hepatitis, alcohol use)? (2) Daily Load vs Recovery: At 50mg oral CBD/day (~0.7 mg/kg), given 6-19% bioavailability and CYP450 first-pass, does the estimated daily ROS/mitochondrial load exceed the 24hr GSH regeneration capacity? What safety margin exists? (3) VDAC Binding Reversibility: Is CBD-VDAC1 binding reversible on the timescale of dosing intervals (12-24 hr)? If allosteric (not pore occlusion), does the gating perturbation persist after CBD dissociates, or does the channel reset? (4) Metabolite Accumulation: 7-OH-CBD has slower clearance than parent CBD. At steady-state daily dosing, does 7-OH-CBD accumulate to concentrations that contribute meaningful VDAC occupancy? Does this effectively widen the occupancy window beyond what parent CBD alone would predict? (5) Dual Pathway Under Chronic Load: The acute model shows parallel ATP starvation + ROS generation (allosteric gating, not occlusion). Under chronic sub-threshold dosing, does cumulative ATP deficit compound independently of ROS/GSH status? Null hypothesis to defeat: Daily 50mg CBD in a healthy liver causes progressive GSH depletion, cumulative VDAC dysfunction, or metabolite-driven occupancy expansion that narrows the safety margin over weeks-months of use.
