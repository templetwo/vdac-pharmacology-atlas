Does the Chol/CL ratio directly control the equilibrium between VDAC1 honeycomb arrays and dispersed monomers, and is this the physical basis for the proposed apoptotic threshold equation?\n2. Does HK-II displacement from VDAC1 trigger honeycomb disassembly by exposing cardiolipin, thereby enabling VDAC oligomerization?\n3. Can lipophilic drugs (e.g., CBD, statins) modulate VDAC organization indirectly via membrane perturbation, independent of direct protein binding?\n4. Is the transition from honeycomb arrays to dispersed monomers the physical \"point of no return\" for apoptosis, making membrane reorganization the rate-limiting step for VDAC oligomerization?\n\nKey variables: Chol/CL ratio, HK-II binding fraction, Bcl-xL binding fraction, membrane order, VDAC oligomerization state.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500 SECTION 2: CLAIMS (max 400 tokens) \u2500\u2500\u2500\nCLAIM: The Chol/CL ratio is a primary physical determinant of the VDAC1 honeycomb-vs-monomer equilibrium, and this lipid-driven partitioning provides the biophysical foundation for the apoptotic threshold equation.\nTYPE: 1\nCONFIDENCE: 0.75\nMECHANISM: Cholesterol and PE promote ordered lipid phases that stabilize VDAC1 lattice contacts, while cardiolipin disrupts these contacts via headgroup charge and packing, creating a tunable equilibrium.\nFALSIFIABLE BY: Demonstrating in reconstituted systems that the threshold for oligomerization is independent of Chol/CL ratio over a physiologically relevant range.\n\nCLAIM: HK-II binding stabilizes honeycomb arrays by masking/displacing cardiolipin from VDAC's vicinity; its displacement unmasks cardiolipin microdomains, promoting lattice disassembly.\nTYPE: 2\nCONFIDENCE: 0.7\nMECHANISM: HK-II's membrane-binding domain competes with cardiolipin for interaction sites near VDAC, so HK-II release increases local cardiolipin availability, destabilizing the array.\nFALSIFIABLE BY: Showing that HK-II displacement does not alter local cardiolipin accessibility or that honeycomb stability is unchanged after HK-II removal in a cardiolipin-free system.\n\nCLAIM: Lipophilic drugs with logP >4 can alter VDAC supramolecular organization indirectly by modulating local membrane order and lipid partitioning, constituting a distinct, non-canonical pharmacological mechanism.\nTYPE: 1\nCONFIDENCE: 0.8\nMECHANISM: Drugs partitioning into the bilayer alter lipid packing and phase behavior, shifting the Chol/CL effective activity and thus the VDAC array equilibrium.\nFALSIFIABLE BY: Demonstrating that such drugs, at therapeutic concentrations, cause no change in VDAC organization in lipid-only reconstitutions without direct protein binding.\n\nCLAIM: The honeycomb-to-dispersed transition is the physical rate-limiting step for VDAC-mediated apoptosis, as oligomerization is only permissible from the dispersed state.\nTYPE: 2\nCONFIDENCE: 0.65\nMECHANISM: The honeycomb array sterically and allosterically inhibits pro-apoptotic oligomerization; disassembly unlocks this conformational capability.\nFALSIFIABLE BY: Observing VDAC oligomerization and cytochrome c release directly from intact honeycomb arrays without prior lattice disassembly.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500 SECTION 3: UNKNOWNS (max 150 tokens) \u2500\u2500\u2500\n1.

Direct experimental evidence that CBD or statins, at physiological concentrations, alter VDAC organization in living cells via membrane effects alone.\n4. The kinetic timescale of honeycomb disassembly versus VDAC oligomerization; which is truly rate-limiting?\n5.
