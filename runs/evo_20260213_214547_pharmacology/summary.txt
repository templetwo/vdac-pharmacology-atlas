QUESTION:
  Does the supramolecular organization of VDAC1 in the outer mitochondrial membrane — specifically its lipid-dependent transition between dense honeycomb arrays and dispersed monomers — determine the pharmacological outcome of VDAC-binding drugs? Recent AFM and molecular dynamics studies (2024-2025) show that: (a) cholesterol and PE stabilize VDAC1 honeycomb assemblies, (b) cardiolipin disrupts these assemblies, freeing VDAC monomers, and (c) VDAC preferentially localizes to cardiolipin-rich OMM-IMM contact sites. Given these findings: (1) Does the Chol/CL ratio in the OMM physically determine the fraction of VDAC1 in honeycomb-protected vs dispersed-oligomerization-competent states, and is this the biophysical basis of the apoptotic threshold equation Threshold = K/[(1-f_HKII)(1-f_BclxL)]*(Chol/CL)? (2) Does HK-II displacement from VDAC1 promote honeycomb disassembly by unmasking cardiolipin microdomains, thereby converting protected VDAC arrays into oligomerization-competent monomers? (3) Can lipophilic drugs (CBD logP 6.3, statins logP 4-5) alter VDAC supramolecular organization by changing local membrane order, independent of direct protein binding — and would this constitute a previously unrecognized mechanism of VDAC pharmacology? (4) Does the honeycomb-to-dispersed transition represent the physical instantiation of the point of no return in VDAC-mediated apoptosis — i.e., is oligomerization only possible from the dispersed state, making membrane reorganization the rate-limiting step rather than any single molecular binding event?
