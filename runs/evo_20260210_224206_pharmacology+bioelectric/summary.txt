HYPOTHESES (ranked by testability):
  H1. IF cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) are treated with 11 µM CBD, THEN ΔΨm will depolarize by ≥20 mV (from ~−120 mV to ~−95 mV), 
     Testability: 9.0/10
     Effect size: 0.9309 (Cohen's d)
     Power: 1.0

  H2. IF CBD cytotoxicity operates through a two-stage mechanism (TRPV1/2 Ca²⁺ priming at 2–4 µM, then VDAC1 engagement at ~11
     Testability: 8.0/10
     Effect size: 0.9473 (Cohen's d)
     Power: 1.0

  H3. IF selectivity is a threshold phenomenon dependent on baseline ΔΨm, THEN pre-treating healthy cells (MCF-10A) with low-d
     Testability: 8.0/10
     Effect size: 0.806 (Cohen's d)
     Power: 1.0

  H4. IF VDAC1's voltage-dependent gating renders it already partially closed at −180 mV (healthy cell potential), THEN CBD (1
