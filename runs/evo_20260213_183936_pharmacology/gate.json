absence of such correlation confirms the claim.\nFEASIBLE: NO \u2014 Prospective CTC isolation, immunofluorescence quantification of VDAC1 per cell, and correlation with bulk tumor biopsy VDAC1 requires specialized CTC platforms (CellSearch, microfluidics) and standardized single-cell immunofluorescence, which are available but not routine; the cohort size needed (n>50 with adequate CTC yield) and follow-up duration make this moderately resource-intensive.\nNOVEL: YES \u2014 The explicit claim that CTC heterogeneity and rarity (1\u2013100/mL) render VDAC1 unreliable *despite* biological plausibility is a critical negative hypothesis that, if validated, would redirect the program away from CTCs toward bulk tumor or circulating DNA approaches.\n\n---\n\n**CLAIM 3:**\nFALSIFIABLE: YES \u2014 The claim is falsified by confirmation from GW Pharma/Jazz Pharmaceuticals that banked samples exist and GSH/GSSG was measured or can be retrospectively assayed.\nFEASIBLE: YES \u2014 Contacting trial sponsors and reviewing published protocols and regulatory submissions (FDA briefing documents) to confirm sample banking and analyte measurement is straightforward.\nNOVEL: NO \u2014 This is a factual claim about trial design, not a scientific hypothesis;

point-of-care technology for these analytes does not currently exist.\nNOVEL: YES \u2014 The claim identifies a critical pre-analytical barrier that, if overcome, would enable the mitochondrial stress panel;
