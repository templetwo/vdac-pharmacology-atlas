Protocol: evo-1.0

QUESTION:
  Can VDAC-related biomarkers predict individual vulnerability to mitochondrial modulators, enabling risk-stratified prescribing? (1) Does baseline GSH/GSSG ratio in peripheral blood or liver function tests (ALT, GGT) reliably predict hepatotoxicity risk from VDAC-engaging drugs (CBD, valproate, acetaminophen)? (2) Is VDAC1 expression level in circulating tumor cells a predictive biomarker for response to VDAC-targeting cancer therapies (erastin, CBD)? (3) Could a simple 'mitochondrial stress test' panel (GSH, ATP/ADP ratio, MMP by TMRM) serve as a companion diagnostic for VDAC-modulating drugs? (4) What existing clinical datasets (Epidiolex trials, erastin Phase I) contain the pharmacokinetic and hepatic biomarker data needed to retrospectively validate this framework?
