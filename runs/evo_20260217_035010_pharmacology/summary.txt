Session: evo_20260217_035010_pharmacology
Date: 2026-02-17
Protocol: evo-1.0

QUESTION:
  Does ultrasound exposure at clinically relevant intensities (0.1-3 W/cm², 1-3 MHz diagnostic or 20-100 kHz therapeutic) alter VDAC1 oligomeric state through outer mitochondrial membrane lipid reorganization? Specifically: (1) Can mechanical energy at these frequencies propagate to the OMM with sufficient intensity to reorganize cholesterol/cardiolipin domains? (2) If so, does lipid domain reorganization shift VDAC1 between honeycomb (protected) and dispersed (oligomerization-competent) states? (3) Does the altered lipid environment of cancer cell OMMs (elevated cholesterol, reduced cardiolipin) change the threshold for mechanically-induced VDAC1 state transitions compared to healthy cells?
