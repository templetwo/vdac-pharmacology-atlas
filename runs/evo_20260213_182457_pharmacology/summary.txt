IRIS GATE EVO — PROTOCOL PACKAGE
============================================================

Session: evo_20260213_182457_pharmacology
Date: 2026-02-13
Protocol: evo-1.0

QUESTION:
  How does the VDAC1 cofactor landscape — specifically hexokinase-II (HK-II) occupancy, Bcl-xL binding, tubulin blockade, and membrane lipid composition (cardiolipin, cholesterol) — determine whether a VDAC-binding small molecule produces cytoprotection vs cytotoxicity? (1) Does HK-II displacement from VDAC1 by CBD or erastin trigger cytochrome c release, and is this the primary death signal rather than direct conductance change? (2) Does the Warburg phenotype (high glycolysis, high HK-II-VDAC1 coupling) paradoxically protect cancer cells from VDAC-mediated apoptosis at low CBD doses while sensitizing them at high doses? (3) Can pharmacological manipulation of the cofactor landscape (e.g., 2-deoxyglucose to displace HK-II, ABT-737 to displace Bcl-xL) predictably shift the VDAC decision gate from survival to apoptosis?
