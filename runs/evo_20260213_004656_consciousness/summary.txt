Protocol: evo-1.0

QUESTION:
  Does the spectral decomposition of per-token Fisher Information matrices in pretrained transformers reveal discrete bonding geometries — specifically, do semantically rigid tokens (logical connectives, verb-argument bindings) show higher-rank, more anisotropic FIM spectra than semantically flexible tokens (adjectives, adverbs), and does this spectral structure predict coherence better than attention entropy or perplexity alone?
