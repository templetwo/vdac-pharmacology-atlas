HYPOTHESES (ranked by testability):
  H1. ** IF isolated mitochondria are voltage-clamped at -120 mV (cancer) vs -180 mV (healthy) and exposed to 11 µM CBD, THEN 
     Testability: 5.0/10
     Effect size: 0.0 (Cohen's d)
     Power: 0.0

  H2. ** IF cancer cells (baseline ROS ~0.45 rel.) are treated with 15 µM CBD, THEN MitoSOX fluorescence will exceed 0.8 rel. 
     Testability: 5.0/10
     Effect size: 0.0 (Cohen's d)
     Power: 0.0

  H3. ** IF healthy cells are pre-depolarized from -180 mV to
     Testability: 5.0/10
     Effect size: 0.0 (Cohen's d)
     Power: 0.0

BUDGET:
