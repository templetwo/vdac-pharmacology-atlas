# Citable evidence for a VDAC1 "Gate-Jamming Score" biomarker in cancer immune evasion

The mechanistic chain linking VDAC1 oligomerization → mtDNA release → cGAS-STING activation → anti-tumor immunity is now supported by converging evidence from structural biology, immunology, and clinical oncology published between 2019 and 2026. **Five high-impact papers form the backbone**: Kim et al. 2019 (*Science*) establishing VDAC oligomers as mtDNA release pores, Xian et al. 2022 (*Immunity*) defining the mPTP-VDAC dual-channel exit route, Daniilidis et al. 2025 (*Nature Communications*) solving the structural basis of VDAC1-mediated apoptosis induction, Prashar et al. 2024 (*Nature*) discovering VDAC1-dependent inner membrane herniation vesicles (VDIMs), and Lai et al. 2025 (*Immunity*) directly connecting VDAC-mediated mtDNA release from senescent tumor cells to immunosuppression. This body of work provides the mechanistic foundation for a composite "Gate-Jamming Score" that quantifies how effectively cancer cells lock VDAC1 in non-oligomerizing states — via HK-II docking, Bcl-xL binding, and cholesterol loading — to suppress the mtDNA-cGAS-STING immune axis and evade checkpoint immunotherapy.

## 1. VDAC1 exists in at least five functional states with distinct biological outputs

VDAC1 (283 residues, 31 kDa) forms a 19-β-strand barrel with an N-terminal α-helix positioned inside the pore. The **open monomer** conducts ~4 nS, is anion-selective, and passes ATP at physiological rates (Choudhary et al. 2014, *Nature Structural & Molecular Biology*). The **closed monomer** arises when the N-terminal 310-helix (M1-G11) unfolds and obstructs the pore, reducing conductance to ~2 nS and switching to cation selectivity (Krammer et al. 2022, *International Journal of Molecular Sciences* 23:1175 — microsecond accelerated MD at ±40 mV). Mannella et al. (2023, *IJMS* 24:6412) used RoseTTAFold to predict that the 19-strand barrel is inherently metastable and evolutionarily selected for gating capacity.

The **physiological dimer** functions as a phospholipid scramblase. Jahn, Bartoš, and Dearden et al. (2023, *Nature Communications* 14:8115) demonstrated that VDAC1 dimers catalyze rapid transbilayer lipid translocation at an interface formed by **β-strands 1, 2, 18, and 19**, where polar residues induce water defects and bilayer thinning. Approximately **90% of crosslinked VDAC1 dimers** were scramblase-active versus only ~30% of monomers. VDAC density exceeds **1,000 molecules per μm² of outer mitochondrial membrane** (OMM), and absence of VDAC homologs reduces mitochondrial phospholipid import by **~10-fold**. A follow-up single-vesicle assay (Jahn et al. 2025, bioRxiv) measured individual dimer activities ranging from <100 to >10,000 lipids per second.

**Oligomeric arrays** of up to 20 VDAC molecules in native OMM have been visualized by AFM. Lafargue et al. (2025, *Communications Biology* 8:936) showed that PE and cholesterol regulate VDAC1 "honeycomb" cluster compaction, with lipid anisotropy extending ≥5 nm from the protein surface. The **death/apoptotic oligomer** — dimers, trimers, tetramers, hexamers and beyond — forms a mega-pore sufficient to release folded cytochrome c (~34 Å diameter). Keinan, Tyomkin, and Shoshan-Barmatz (2010, *Molecular and Cellular Biology* 30:5698) established that all tested apoptosis inducers increase VDAC1 oligomerization **up to 20-fold**, detected as ~68 kDa (dimer), ~99 kDa (trimer), and ~136 kDa (tetramer) bands by EGS crosslinking. Geula et al. (2012, *Journal of Biological Chemistry* 287:2179) mapped the death oligomer interface to β-strands 8, 16, and 17 in addition to the physiological dimer interface.

The structural mechanism was resolved by Daniilidis, Günsel et al. (2025, *Nature Communications* 16:9481) using cryo-EM, NMR, and X-ray crystallography. Upon oligomerization, VDAC1's N-terminal α-helix (VDAC1-N) is **exposed to the pore exterior** and binds directly to the BH3 binding groove of Bcl-xL. VDAC1-N functions as a **BH3-only sensitizer**, neutralizing Bcl-xL and thereby promoting Bak pore formation and MOMP. This paper provides the first structural link between VDAC1 oligomerization and the canonical Bcl-2 family apoptosis machinery.

Eddy/Najbauer et al. (2022, *JACS* 144:9882 and 144:2953) contributed MAS NMR structures of hVDAC1 in lipid bilayers at **2.2 Å RMSD**, confirming the barrel-helix architecture and identifying three cholesterol binding sites on the barrel exterior. Li et al. (2024, *Aging* 16:205660) solved cryo-EM structures of VDAC in complex with the ER membrane complex (EMC) at **3.32 Å**, revealing conserved VDAC-EMC interactions at mitochondria-ER contact sites.

## 2. VDAC1 oligomers release mtDNA fragments that activate cGAS-STING innate immunity

**Kim et al. (2019, *Science* 366:1531)** demonstrated that oxidatively stressed mitochondria release **500–650 bp mtDNA fragments** through VDAC oligomeric pores in live, non-apoptotic cells. Three positively charged N-terminal residues (Lys12, Arg15, Lys20) interact with mtDNA and promote VDAC1 oligomerization through a positive feedback loop. VDAC1/3 double-knockout MEFs showed dramatically reduced cytoplasmic mtDNA and interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression. VBIT-4 (10 μM) blocked mtDNA release and reduced lupus-like disease severity in MRL/lpr mice.

**Xian et al. (2022, *Immunity* 55:1370)** refined this to a two-step model: NLRP3 activators stimulate MCU-mediated calcium uptake → mPTP opening → VDAC oligomerization. FEN1 endonuclease cleaves oxidized mtDNA to 500–650 bp fragments that exit via mPTP and VDAC channels. CsA (mPTP inhibitor) reduced cytosolic oxidized mtDNA by **60±6%**; VBIT-4 reduced it by **81±4%**. Critically, mPTP opening precedes VDAC oligomerization.

**Prashar et al. (2024, *Nature* 632:1110)** discovered VDIMs (Vesicles Derived from the Inner Membrane) — a constitutive quality-control pathway where ROS-damaged cristae trigger TRPML1-mediated VDAC1 oligomerization, enabling inner membrane herniation through VDAC pores. A proportion of VDIMs contain oxidized mtDNA and mitochondrial nucleoids. Both VBIT-12 and VDAC1 siRNA abolished VDIM formation.

**Lai et al. (2025, *Immunity* 58:811)** provided the most directly cancer-relevant evidence: senescent tumor cells release mtDNA specifically via VDACs — not BAX/BAK or mPTP. Silencing Vdac1 or Vdac2 reduced both cytosolic and extracellular mtDNA. This mtDNA was packaged in extracellular vesicles, selectively internalized by PMN-MDSCs, and activated cGAS-STING-NF-κB signaling to enhance immunosuppression (Arg1, Nos2, PD-L1 upregulation). VDAC inhibition blocked mtDNA release and reversed immunosuppression.

Wu et al. (2023, *Experimental & Molecular Medicine* 55:269) showed Parkin E3 ligase ubiquitinates VDAC1 at K53 to interrupt oligomerization and prevent mtDNA release; the K53R ubiquitination-defective mutant exhibited persistent mtDNA release activating STING in hepatic stellate cells. A 2025 paper in *Free Radical Biology and Medicine* identified VDAC1 oligomerization as the initiator of mtDNA leakage → cGAS-STING → PANoptosome assembly in age-related macular degeneration, with O-GlcNAcylation at T165 promoting oligomerization. Kim, Kim, and Chung (2023, *Experimental & Molecular Medicine* 55:510) codified the two-pathway model in a comprehensive review: VDAC oligomers for moderate stress in live cells; BAX/BAK macropores for apoptotic cells.

## 3. The cGAS-STING pathway is required for checkpoint inhibitor efficacy but acts as a double-edged sword

**Woo et al. (2014, *Immunity* 41:830)** established that spontaneous CD8+ T cell priming against tumors was **defective in STING-knockout mice** but not in MyD88⁻/⁻, TRIF⁻/⁻, TLR4⁻/⁻, TLR9⁻/⁻, or MAVS⁻/⁻ mice. Tumor-derived DNA within intratumoral dendritic cell cytosol activates cGAS/STING/IRF3 → IFN-β → DC cross-presentation. **Corrales et al. (2015, *Cell Reports* 11:1018)** showed intratumoral STING agonists induced complete regression in multiple syngeneic mouse models with systemic memory responses.

Samson and Ablasser (2022, *Nature Cancer* 3:1452) authored the authoritative review on the dual role: acute cGAS-STING activation drives anti-tumor immunity, while chronic activation promotes immunosuppression via PD-L1 upregulation, MDSC recruitment, and T cell exhaustion. Lu et al. (2025, *Nature Reviews Cancer*) noted no STING agonist has achieved FDA approval despite promising preclinical data. Gehrcken et al. (2025, *Advanced Science* 12:2500296) confirmed that "the absence of STING or IRF3 leads to diminished anti-tumoral immune response and reduced responses to checkpoint inhibitors."

**Carozza et al. (2023, *PNAS*)** identified ENPP1 as an innate immune checkpoint: ENPP1-low patients had significantly higher pathological complete response to pembrolizumab in I-SPY2, with low ENPP1 predicting distant-metastasis-free survival up to 7 years. Harrington et al. (2025, *Clinical Cancer Research* 31:3400) reported Phase I/II data for intratumoral ulevostinag (MK-1454) ± pembrolizumab. ADU-S100 + pembrolizumab in recurrent HNSCC achieved **16.7% complete response and 83.3% partial response**.

The double-edged sword is critical for the GJS concept. The Lai et al. 2025 *Immunity* paper shows VDAC-mediated mtDNA from senescent tumor cells **enhances immunosuppression** via MDSCs. A 2025 *Frontiers in Immunology* review on the mtDNA-cGAS-STING axis in tumor immunity confirms acute activation promotes CD8+ T/NK cytotoxicity while sustained activation drives PD-L1 upregulation and T cell exhaustion. The net immunological outcome depends on cellular context, signaling duration, and which immune populations are engaged.

## 4. HK-II docking on VDAC1 blocks oligomerization and links the Warburg effect to immune evasion

**Wolf et al. (2023, *Science Immunology* 8:eade7652)** provided the key mechanistic link: HK2 dissociation from VDAC1 directly triggers VDAC1 oligomerization and NLRP3 recruitment. ATP treatment causes specific HK2 (not HK1) release within 15 minutes. Bieker, Timme et al. (2025, *Communications Biology* 8:212) identified the binding site — a **membrane-buried glutamate (E73 in VDAC1)** on the outer barrel wall. Protonation blocks complex formation; cytosolic acidification causes reversible HK-I release. Haloi et al. (2021, *Communications Biology* 4:667) modeled the binary complex showing HK-II first inserts its N-terminal hydrophobic helix into the OMM, then interacts with VDAC1, causing partial pore blockade confirmed by electrophysiology.

Under normal blood glucose, **70–80% of HK2 is mitochondria-bound** (He et al. 2025, *International Journal of Medical Sciences* 22:790). Pan-cancer TCGA analysis across 33 tumor types confirmed HK2 overexpression in most cancers (Li et al. 2022, *Scientific Reports* 12:18807). In hepatocellular carcinoma, HK2 was overexpressed in **55.67% of clinical specimens** correlating with poor survival. In breast cancer, **68% of tumors** showed high HK2 expression with significant correlation to late clinical stage and distant metastasis (Shahid et al. 2022, *Genes* 13:549). The Warburg effect connection is direct: HK-II bound to VDAC1 gains preferential access to mitochondrial ATP, fueling aerobic glycolysis while simultaneously preventing the oligomerization required for cytochrome c release, mtDNA egress, and cGAS-STING activation.

Disruption strategies include methyl jasmonate (**IC₅₀ = 7.47 µM** for HK2 inhibition; novel 1,2,4-oxadiazole analogs achieve IC₅₀ = 0.27 µM), fenbendazole (IC₅₀ = 0.25 µM), and VDAC1-based cell-penetrating peptides that selectively kill CLL cells while sparing healthy PBMCs (Shteinfer-Kuzmine et al. 2024, *Biomolecules* 14:1139). Abu-Hamad et al. (2009, *Journal of Cell Science* 122:1906) showed N-terminal truncated VDAC1 cannot release cytochrome c and is resistant to apoptosis — HK-II and Bcl-2 both require the VDAC1 N-terminus for their protective effects.

## 5. Bcl-xL protects through a mechanistically distinct VDAC1 interaction — the BH4-mediated calcium gate

Arbel, Ben-Hail, and Shoshan-Barmatz (2012, *Journal of Biological Chemistry* 287:23152) demonstrated direct Bcl-xL/VDAC1 interaction by co-immunoprecipitation and bilayer electrophysiology: Bcl-xL **reduced VDAC1 channel conductance**. VDAC1 mutations E65Q, E72Q, E202Q and N-terminal truncation (Δ26) abolished binding. **Monaco et al. (2015, *Journal of Biological Chemistry* 290:9150)** established the critical distinction: Bcl-xL acts via its **BH4 domain** to suppress mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake through VDAC1, while Bcl-2's BH4 domain targets IP3Rs at the ER. This creates a division of labor — Bcl-2 protects at the ER, Bcl-xL protects at mitochondria.

The Daniilidis et al. 2025 *Nature Communications* paper transformed understanding of this interaction: when VDAC1 oligomerizes and exposes its N-terminal helix, VDAC1-N binds the BH3 groove of Bcl-xL, acting as a **BH3-only sensitizer** to neutralize Bcl-xL and free Bak for pore formation. This means Bcl-xL binding to VDAC1 normally prevents N-terminal exposure and downstream apoptotic signaling.

A December 2025 bioRxiv preprint showed Bcl-xL expression increases in therapy-induced senescent cells with increased mitochondrial localization. Proximity ligation assay quantification found **298 ± 23 Bcl-xL/VDAC1 interaction dots** in doxorubicin-treated versus **205 ± 18** in control cells (p<0.001). ABT-263 (navitoclax) disrupted this interaction, increasing mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake and converting senescence to apoptosis. Bessou et al. (2020, *Oncogene* 39:3428) showed Bcl-xL/VDAC1 controls breast cancer cell migration via mitochondria-dependent ROS, with high *bclx* expression being a poor prognosis factor in ER-positive breast cancer.

Importantly, BH3-mimetics like venetoclax target the BH3 groove and **do not disrupt BH4-mediated VDAC1 interactions** (2025 *Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy* review). This means current clinical Bcl-2 inhibitors leave the VDAC1-specific protection intact, highlighting a therapeutic gap the GJS framework could address.

| Feature | HK-II | Bcl-xL |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Binding site | E73 membrane-buried glutamate + N-terminal region | N-terminal region + BH4 domain interaction |
| Mechanism | Blocks oligomerization, partial pore blockade | Reduces conductance, suppresses Ca²⁺ flux |
| Metabolic coupling | Direct — Warburg effect driver | None — pro-migratory/metastatic |
| Cancer context | Overexpressed 55–68% across tumor types | Poor prognosis in ER+ breast cancer |

## 6. Cholesterol loading of mitochondrial membranes creates a third jamming mechanism

VDAC1 co-purifies with **five cholesterol molecules per protein**, mapped by photo-affinity labeling to five distinct sites on the barrel exterior (Cheng et al. 2019, *Biochimica et Biophysica Acta – Molecular and Cell Biology of Lipids* 1864:1269). The most characterized is the **E73/F99/Y62 pocket** on β-strand 4, where cholesterol's 3-hydroxyl positions **5.4 Å from the E73 carbonyl** — the same E73 that HK-II requires for binding. NMR studies (Najbauer et al. 2022, *JACS* 144:2953) showed cholesterol stabilizes the open state and reduces channel closure frequency.

**Montero et al. (2008, *Cancer Research* 68:5246)** demonstrated that HCC mitochondria exhibit significantly elevated cholesterol, increased membrane order, and **resistance to Bax-mediated membrane permeabilization** and cytochrome c release. StAR (STARD1) is overexpressed in HCC, driving cholesterol to mitochondria; siRNA knockdown sensitized HCC to chemotherapy. Goicoechea et al. (2023, *Redox Biology* 61:102643) established that normal mitochondrial cholesterol content is **~5% of total cellular cholesterol** versus ~60–80% in plasma membrane. In cancer, compensatory HIF-1α-mediated SLC25A11 upregulation maintains mitochondrial GSH despite cholesterol loading, protecting cardiolipin from oxidation and conferring **dual anti-apoptotic protection** — cholesterol rigidifying the membrane plus intact cardiolipin preventing pro-apoptotic lipid phases.

Betaneli et al. (2012, *Biophysical Journal* 102:523) made a finding critical to the GJS concept: **cardiolipin disrupts VDAC supramolecular assemblies** while phosphatidylglycerol enhances oligomerization. During apoptosis, CL levels decrease and PG increases, favoring oligomerization and cytochrome c release. Lucken-Ardjomande et al. (2008, *Cell Death & Differentiation* 15:484) showed cholesterol inhibits Bax activation and oligomerization in MOM-like liposomes. The composite picture: elevated cholesterol/cardiolipin ratio in cancer mitochondria simultaneously rigidifies membranes against MOMP, stabilizes VDAC1 in the open monomeric state, and disfavors the oligomeric transitions required for mtDNA release. This constitutes a third "gate-jamming" mechanism independent of protein-protein interactions.

Lafargue et al. (2025, *Communications Biology* 8:936) showed by AFM and MD that **deviations from physiological lipid content disrupt native VDAC assemblies**, with cholesterol and PE preferentially occupying the first lipid layer contacting VDAC1. Montero et al. (2010, *BBA – Bioenergetics* 1797:1217) articulated the cholesterol/peroxidized-cardiolipin "rheostat" model: the balance between membrane rigidification (cholesterol) and lipid phase destabilization (peroxidized CL) determines the apoptotic threshold.

## 7. Current biomarkers miss the mitochondrial dimension of immune-cold tumors

The overall objective response rate to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monotherapy is approximately **24% (95% CI: 21–28%)** across solid tumors. Three FDA-approved biomarkers — PD-L1, TMB, MSI-H — each have well-documented limitations. PD-L1 has predictive value in only **28.9% of FDA approvals**; 15% of PD-L1-negative patients still respond while over half of PD-L1-positive patients do not. TMB ≥10 mut/Mb yields ORR of 41% but varies widely by cancer type, and the proportion of TMB-high tumors ranges from 0% (kidney) to 53% (melanoma). MSI-H is a strong predictor but only relevant in ~4–15% of common cancers.

**None of these biomarkers captures the metabolic dimension of immune evasion.** Three landmark papers establish mitochondrial dysfunction as a causal driver of immune failure:

- **Ikeda et al. (2025, *Nature*)**: Cancer cells transfer mitochondria carrying mutated mtDNA to TILs, causing homoplasmic replacement, metabolic abnormalities, senescence, and defective effector function. mtDNA mutations in TILs correlated with poor ICI response in melanoma and NSCLC. Five of 12 patients had shared tumor-TIL mtDNA mutations.

- **Mangalhara et al. (2023, *Science* 381:1316)**: Loss of Complex II → succinate accumulation → transcriptional activation of MHC-I/antigen processing genes **independent of IFN signaling**. Demonstrates that ETC configuration directly determines tumor immunogenicity.

- **Wu et al. (2023, *Nature Communications* 14:6858)**: Mitochondrial insufficiency initiates functional exhaustion of T cells through HIF-1α-mediated glycolytic reprogramming.

Li et al. (2022, *Journal of Experimental Medicine* 219:e20202084) identified a high-OXPHOS CD8+ T cell subset (CD38+, CD39+) in both tumor and peripheral blood that predicts immunotherapy resistance — a potential blood-based biomarker. The SCORPIO machine-learning system (Nature Medicine 2024) using routine blood tests achieved median **AUC(t) of 0.763** for OS prediction, outperforming TMB (0.503–0.543), validating that latent metabolic signals exist in standard clinical data.

cGAS-STING pathway silencing via promoter methylation occurs in **1–25% of tumors** pan-cancer. HER2-AKT activation selectively abrogates TBK1-IRF3 signaling downstream of STING. These defects render tumors immune-cold regardless of mutational burden. Galassi et al. (2024, *Cancer Cell* 42:1825) proposed the "Three Cs" framework for immune evasion: Camouflage, Coercion, and Cytoprotection — with metabolic alterations as a Coercion mechanism. The GJS concept would address the gap by integrating VDAC1 expression/oligomerization state, HK-II/Bcl-xL occupancy, mitochondrial cholesterol, and STING pathway status into a composite mitochondrial-immune biomarker.

## 8. VDAC1 oligomerization extends beyond apoptosis into ferroptosis, PANoptosis, and inflammasome signaling

Recent work has expanded VDAC1 oligomerization from an apoptosis-specific event to a broader cell-fate regulator. Jang et al. (2024, *Cell Death & Disease* 15:811) showed VDAC1 oligomerization is essential for cysteine deprivation-induced ferroptosis, with pharmacological inhibitors blocking ferroptosis by reducing mitochondrial ROS. Ren et al. (2025, *Nature Communications* 16:1534) identified VSTM2L as a VDAC1-binding protein that enhances HK2-VDAC1 interaction and prevents oligomerization; VSTM2L knockdown sensitized prostate cancer cells to ferroptosis. Wan et al. (2026, *Neural Regeneration Research* 21(4)) demonstrated VDAC1 oligomerization regulates **PANoptosis** (pyroptosis + apoptosis + necroptosis) in retinal injury, with VBIT-12 reducing all three death pathways simultaneously.

Shoshan-Barmatz et al. (2025, *Biomolecules* 16:141) showed p53 directly binds VDAC1 by MST and bilayer experiments, reduces channel conductance, and induces oligomerization even without apoptotic stimuli when overexpressed. This positions VDAC1 oligomerization as a convergence point for p53-dependent and -independent death signaling.

A critical methodological caveat: Ravishankar et al. (2025, bioRxiv) challenged VBIT-4 specificity using high-speed AFM and single-channel electrophysiology, showing VBIT-4 **partitions into lipid bilayers at micromolar concentrations and disrupts membrane structure** independent of VDAC1. At 30 μM, VBIT-4 induced membrane rupture. This urges caution in interpreting VBIT-4-dependent results and suggests that claims based solely on VBIT-4 require orthogonal validation (e.g., genetic approaches).

## 9. CBD modulates VDAC1 conductance and triggers oligomerization-dependent cancer cell death

**Rimmerman et al. (2013, *Cell Death & Disease* 4:e949)** established CBD as a direct VDAC1 ligand. Purified VDAC1 in planar lipid bilayers showed CBD **strongly decreased conductance at all voltages (−60 to +60 mV)**, maintaining the channel in a low-conductance state. MST confirmed direct binding (**Kd ~11 µM**); anandamide showed no interaction. CBD depolarized mitochondrial membrane potential (**IC₅₀ = 10 µM** by TMRM), induced ROS (**EC₅₀ = 4.9 µM** by carboxy-H₂DCFDA), and triggered biphasic intracellular calcium increases. Cholesterol enrichment (50 µM) significantly attenuated CBD-induced death.

**Gorny et al. (2023, *Journal of Enzyme Inhibition and Medicinal Chemistry* 38:2121821)** validated CBD-VDAC1 binding using NanoDSF and MST, refining **Kd to 6 µM** and showing CBD increases VDAC1 thermal stability. CBD ranked among the top 4 VDAC1 ligands alongside curcumin (Kd = 6 µM), DIDS (Kd = 0.5 µM), and VBIT-4 (Kd = 3 µM). Olivas-Aguirre et al. (2019, *Cell Death & Disease* 10:779) performed molecular docking predicting CBD interacts with **N-terminus residues (Thr9, Asp12, Leu13) and β9–11 pore wall residues** on hVDAC1.

**Fadzeyeva et al. (2026, *Pharmaceuticals* 19:95)** — the most recent paper — demonstrated CBD-induced **VDAC1 oligomerization-dependent** effects: CBD downregulated surface CD47 ("don't eat me" signal) and induced apoptosis in Jurkat leukemia cells; the VDAC1 oligomerization inhibitor NSC15364 rescued both phenotypes. This dual mechanism — apoptosis plus immune exposure via CD47 loss — is directly relevant to the GJS framework. Mahmoud et al. (2023, *Pharmacological Research* 189:106683) showed CBD modulates **VDAC1–HK-II coupling** in hormone-refractory prostate cancer, increasing glycolytic capacity while inhibiting OXPHOS in enzalutamide-resistant cells. Gross et al. (2021, *Frontiers in Pharmacology* 12:725136) demonstrated that VDAC1 inhibition — but not TRPV1 inhibition — rescued glioma cells from CBD cytotoxicity, confirming VDAC1 as the critical target.

Wu et al. (2018, *Free Radical Biology and Medicine* 124:311) established the temporal sequence in human monocytes: MMP depolarization within **5 minutes**, cardiolipin oxidation within **15 minutes**, ROS at 1–2 hours — all preceding caspase activation and apoptosis. CsA (mPTP inhibitor) markedly attenuated all downstream effects.

## 10. Multi-LLM convergence has emerging but growing precedent as scientific methodology

**Schoenegger et al. (2024, *Science Advances* 10(45))** — the strongest precedent — used **12 independent LLMs** for probabilistic predictions on 31 binary forecasting questions, finding the aggregated LLM crowd was **statistically indistinguishable from 925 human forecasters**. Model diversity across architectures was key. Chen et al. (2024, *ACL Proceedings* pp. 7066–7085) showed their ReConcile framework using ChatGPT, Bard, and Claude2 in round-table consensus surpassed single-agent baselines by up to **11.4%**, with model family diversity contributing 6.8% of gains.

Google's AI Co-Scientist (Gottweis et al. 2025) deployed multi-agent "generate, debate, and evolve" cycles for scientific hypothesis generation, with experimental validation published in *Cell* — none of the individual general-purpose LLMs replicated the correct hypotheses independently. Xu et al. (2024) used multiple LLM agents as Researcher, Reviewer, and Moderator for Alzheimer's drug combination prediction (Coated-LLM), achieving **0.74 accuracy via majority-vote consensus** versus 0.52 for traditional methods. Swanson et al. (2024, *Journal of the Royal Society Interface*) validated 3/12 GPT-4-generated drug synergy hypotheses in the lab and explicitly noted cross-model convergence patterns between GPT-4, Gemini, and PubMedGPT.

Du et al. (2023, ICML 2024) established the foundational "society of minds" approach where multi-LLM debate reduces factual hallucinations. A 2025 arXiv preprint (2601.07245) proposed treating inter-LLM agreement patterns as structured objects encoding correctness information. Kamen (2025, arXiv 2511.15714) applied the **Condorcet Jury Theorem** to LLM ensembles, formally connecting multi-LLM majority voting to classical collective intelligence theory. Zhi et al. (2025, arXiv 2502.18036) provided the first systematic survey of LLM ensemble methods.

The theoretical grounding comes from extending classical ensemble learning and the Condorcet Jury Theorem to independently trained LLMs with diverse architectures: if each model is independently more likely than not to be correct, majority agreement converges exponentially on truth as the number of models increases.

## Conclusion: the evidence base supports a mechanistically grounded composite biomarker

The literature reviewed here establishes a complete mechanistic chain from VDAC1 functional state → mtDNA release → cGAS-STING activation → anti-tumor immunity, with three orthogonal "gate-jamming" mechanisms — HK-II docking, Bcl-xL binding, and cholesterol loading — that cancer cells deploy to suppress this signaling axis. The key insight for the GJS concept is that **these three mechanisms are independently measurable and additively suppress immune sensing**. HK-II occupancy is quantifiable by IHC and transcriptomics (overexpressed in 55–68% of tumors); Bcl-xL/VDAC1 interaction is measurable by PLA or expression ratio; and mitochondrial cholesterol can be estimated from StAR/STARD1 expression (amplified in breast cancer, overexpressed in HCC). STING pathway status (promoter methylation, 1–25% of tumors) provides the downstream readout.

Two nuances require emphasis. First, the cGAS-STING axis is a **double-edged sword** — the Lai et al. 2025 *Immunity* paper shows VDAC-mediated mtDNA from senescent tumor cells can paradoxically enhance immunosuppression through MDSCs, meaning the GJS must account for temporal dynamics and cellular context. Second, the VBIT-4 specificity challenge (Ravishankar et al. 2025 bioRxiv) means several foundational claims about VDAC1 oligomerization inhibition require reinterpretation — genetic approaches (VDAC1/3 knockout, K53R mutants, VSTM2L knockdown) provide more robust validation of the oligomerization-dependent pathway. Despite these caveats, the convergence of structural, biochemical, immunological, and clinical evidence from independent laboratories using orthogonal methods — plus the emerging precedent for multi-LLM convergence as a hypothesis-generation methodology — provides a rigorous foundation for the GJS biomarker concept in a bioRxiv manuscript.
