Dear bioRxiv Editors,

We submit a research manuscript presenting a novel composite biomarker --- the Gate-Jamming Score (GJS) --- that links VDAC1 mitochondrial gating to checkpoint inhibitor non-response in cancer.

**What this paper reports:**

This manuscript presents new computational findings from a structured multi-model convergence analysis. Five independent large language models (Claude, Gemini, Grok, Mistral, DeepSeek) were queried with the same compiled pharmacology question, responded without cross-exposure, and their outputs were synthesized through server-side semantic embedding and clustering. The convergence data constitute new computational results: quantified agreement metrics (cosine similarity, kappa, TYPE classification), cross-run validation across 28 independent analyses (27,931 pairwise comparisons, 15 semantic matches), and Monte Carlo robustness testing of three operationalized hypotheses with predicted effect sizes.

**The central finding:**

Cancer cells suppress VDAC1 oligomerization --- and therefore mtDNA release and cGAS-STING innate immune activation --- through three independently measurable mechanisms: hexokinase-II docking, Bcl-xL binding, and cholesterol loading of the outer mitochondrial membrane. We formalize these into a composite Gate-Jamming Score (GJS) that predicts immune-cold tumor status and checkpoint inhibitor non-response. Each component of the mechanistic chain is supported by published experimental evidence (Kim et al. 2019, *Science*; Wolf et al. 2023, *Science Immunology*; Daniilidis et al. 2025, *Nature Communications*; Lai et al. 2025, *Immunity*). The integration of these components into a predictive biomarker framework is the novel contribution.

**Manuscript structure:**

The manuscript follows standard IMRaD format with Abstract, Introduction, Methods (full protocol description), Results (convergence data, GJS derivation, cross-run validation, three operationalized hypotheses with protocols and null outcomes), Discussion (including explicit limitations), and References (~40 citations). All data, code, and convergence scores are openly available on HuggingFace, GitHub, and OSF.

**Why this belongs on bioRxiv:**

This is a complete research manuscript reporting new computational findings with testable predictions, specified protocols, and explicit falsification criteria. It is not a review, commentary, or hypothesis without data. The convergence analysis constitutes the computational data; the GJS constitutes the novel finding; the three operationalized hypotheses with Monte Carlo-validated effect sizes constitute the actionable output.

We believe this work will be of interest to the immuno-oncology, mitochondrial biology, and computational biology communities.
